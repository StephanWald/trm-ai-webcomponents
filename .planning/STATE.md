### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v1.1 key decisions:
- Original prototypes are the visual source of truth — sp-org-chart and sp-walkthrough must match 1:1
- sp-popover (Phase 9) built before language/comm components so they can use it for dropdowns
- sp-markdown-editor has no parity work in v1.1 — already production-ready
