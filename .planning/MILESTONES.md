**Phases completed:** 6 phases, 20 plans
**Timeline:** 22 days (Jan 30 → Feb 21, 2026)
**Commits:** 103 (29 feat)
**Files:** 155 files, ~21,300 LOC TypeScript/CSS

**Key accomplishments:**
1. Stencil.js v4 build pipeline with dual output targets (dist + dist-custom-elements), DWC theming, CI/CD workflows
2. `<sp-org-chart>` — hierarchical tree rendering, drag-and-drop reorganization, filtering, long-press deletion
3. `<sp-walkthrough>` — YouTube/video integration, timeline engine, overlay manager, author mode, draggable panel
4. `<sp-markdown-editor>` — source/WYSIWYG/split modes, formatting toolbar, voice dictation, import/export, auto-save
5. 70% code coverage enforcement across all components with fallback tests for unthemed usage
6. Docusaurus documentation site with live examples, auto-generated API references, getting-started and theming guides
