<objective>
Close two verification gaps from Phase 6: (1) update ROADMAP.md success criterion 5 to reflect the changelog-based versioning approach (approved by CONTEXT.md as Claude's discretion, recommended by RESEARCH.md), and (2) update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability to mark all completed requirements, then guide the user through GitHub remote setup and first publish to close the npm/CDN availability gap.

Purpose: Align planning documents with implemented reality and unblock the final publishing step that requires human action (GitHub remote creation, NPM_TOKEN secret).
Output: Updated ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md; user has clear instructions for remote setup and publishing.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md to close documentation gaps</name>
  <files>.planning/ROADMAP.md, .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
    In `.planning/ROADMAP.md`:
    1. Update Phase 6 success criterion 5 from:
       "Documentation versioning keeps docs in sync with component releases, showing version picker with historical API references"
       to:
       "Documentation stays in sync with component releases via changelog page tracking all versions; full Docusaurus version picker deferred to v1.0.0 per research recommendation"
    2. Update Phase 6 Plans count from "4 plans" to "5 plans" and add the gap closure plan to the plan list:
       `- [ ] 06-05-PLAN.md -- Gap closure: ROADMAP alignment and publishing readiness`
    3. Update Phase 5 plan list to mark 05-03 as complete: `- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md`

    In `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`:
    1. Mark TEST-03 status as "Complete" in the traceability table (coverage thresholds are enforced in stencil.config.ts and CI)
    2. Mark TEST-04 status as "Complete" in the traceability table (fallback tests were added in Phase 5)
    3. Mark DOCS-06 status as "Complete" in the traceability table (changelog-based versioning implemented)
    4. Mark INFRA-07 status as "Complete" in the traceability table (release.yml has provenance config)
    5. Update the checkbox next to TEST-03 and TEST-04 in the requirements list from `[ ]` to `[x]`

    These updates align the planning documents with the actual implemented state. The versioning approach follows the RESEARCH.md recommendation ("changelog-only for v1") and falls within Claude's discretion per CONTEXT.md.

  <name>Task 2: Configure GitHub remote and publish package</name>
  <action>
    The following steps require human action because they involve account authentication and secret management that Claude cannot perform:

    **Step 1: Create GitHub repository**
    - Go to https://github.com/new
    - Create repository: `trm-ai-webcomponents` under the appropriate organization
    - Do NOT initialize with README (repo already has content)

    **Step 2: Add GitHub remote and push**
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<org>/trm-ai-webcomponents.git
    git push -u origin master
    ```

    **Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages**
    - Go to repo Settings > Pages
    - Under "Build and deployment", set Source to "GitHub Actions"
    - The `docs-deploy.yml` workflow will deploy automatically on next push to master

    **Step 4: Configure NPM_TOKEN secret**
    - Create an npm automation token at https://www.npmjs.com/settings/<user>/tokens
    - Token type: Granular Access Token with read+write for `@skillspilot/webcomponents`
    - Go to repo Settings > Secrets > Actions
    - Add secret: `NPM_TOKEN` with the token value

    **Step 5: Trigger first publish**
    - Option A: Create a changeset (`npx changeset`), commit, push, and merge the resulting version PR
    - Option B: Manually publish: `npm run build && npm publish --access public`

    **Step 6: Verify CDN availability**
    - After publish, verify: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@skillspilot/webcomponents/dist/skillspilot/skillspilot.esm.js`
    - And: `https://unpkg.com/@skillspilot/webcomponents/dist/skillspilot/skillspilot.esm.js`

    **Step 7: Update Docusaurus config (optional)**
    - If the GitHub org/repo name differs from `skillspilot/trm-ai-webcomponents`, update:
      - `docs/docusaurus.config.ts`: `url`, `baseUrl`, `organizationName`, `projectName`
      - Push changes to trigger docs redeploy
  </action>
  <resume-signal>Type "published" when npm package is live and GitHub Pages is deployed, or "skip" to defer publishing to a later session</resume-signal>
</task>

1. ROADMAP.md success criterion 5 no longer references "version picker" — reflects changelog approach
2. REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table shows all Phase 5 and Phase 6 requirements as Complete
3. No orphaned requirements remain (all 68 v1 requirements mapped and completed)
4. GitHub remote configured (post human action)
5. GitHub Pages site accessible at published URL (post human action)
6. npm package installable via `npm install @skillspilot/webcomponents` (post human action)

<success_criteria>
- Planning documents accurately reflect implemented state
- User has clear, actionable instructions for GitHub remote + npm publishing
- All verification gaps from 06-VERIFICATION.md are addressed (Gap 2 closed by document update, Gap 1 unblocked by human action steps)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/06-documentation-publishing/06-05-SUMMARY.md`
