¹ Early plans (07-01, 07-02, 08-01) predate the `requirements_completed` frontmatter convention. All 12 "missing" requirements have detailed VERIFICATION.md evidence confirming they are satisfied.

**Orphaned requirements:** None — all 50 requirement IDs in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table appear in at least one VERIFICATION.md.

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 7: Org Chart Parity
- `src/index.html` demo page uses v1.0 User data model (`name` instead of `firstName`/`lastName`) — org chart tiles render broken display names at runtime

### Phase 10: Language & Voice
- `languageChange` `@Event` name conflicts with native DOM `change` event variant — E2E binding requires workaround in some host application setups

### Phase 12: Docs & Tests
- `docs/docs/getting-started.md` Quick Start example uses stale v1.0 API (`chart.nodes`, `name`, `parentId` instead of `chart.users`, `firstName`, `reportsTo`)
- Individual branch coverage below 70% on 4 files (sp-language-selector 35.71%, sp-popover 44.82%, sp-voice-input-button 61.76%, markdown-renderer 62.5%) — global threshold passes at 77.45%

**Total: 5 items across 3 phases**

## Human Verification Items (aggregated from phase VERIFICATIONs)

All phases flagged visual/browser items that cannot be verified programmatically. These are standard for UI component libraries:

- Phase 7: Vertical list CSS connectors, drag preview following cursor, countdown overlay, drop zone positioning
- Phase 8: Tabler SVG icon visual correctness, scene list popup positioning, vertical volume slider, caption overlay, highlight glow animations
- Phase 9: Fade+slide animation, placement flip visual, DWC token resolution
- Phase 10: Viewport boundary dropdown flip, hover cue animation, pulse animation, shake animation
- Phase 11: Dropdown positioning, backdrop blur quality, fade/slide smoothness, dark theme rendering, backdrop click guard
- Phase 12: Docusaurus build, ApiReference prop table rendering, LiveExample iframe initialization
